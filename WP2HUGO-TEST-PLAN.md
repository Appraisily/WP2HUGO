## File Path Issue Resolution

During testing, we identified a file path inconsistency where some components save files to `output/research/` while others expect them in different locations. If you encounter this issue, use the following script to fix it:

```javascript
// Copy the file from copy-file.js
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

// Define source and destination paths for optimized content
const sourcePath1 = path.join(process.cwd(), 'output', 'research', 'antique-electric-hurricane-lamps-anthropic-seo-optimized.json');
const destPath1 = path.join(process.cwd(), 'output', 'optimized', 'antique-electric-hurricane-lamps.json');

// Define source and destination paths for enhanced content
const sourcePath2 = path.join(process.cwd(), 'output', 'research', 'antique-electric-hurricane-lamps-anthropic-enhanced.json');
const destPath2 = path.join(process.cwd(), 'output', 'enhanced', 'antique-electric-hurricane-lamps.json');

// Ensure the destination directories exist
const destDir1 = path.dirname(destPath1);
if (!fs.existsSync(destDir1)) {
  fs.mkdirSync(destDir1, { recursive: true });
  console.log(`Created directory: ${destDir1}`);
}

const destDir2 = path.dirname(destPath2);
if (!fs.existsSync(destDir2)) {
  fs.mkdirSync(destDir2, { recursive: true });
  console.log(`Created directory: ${destDir2}`);
}

// Copy the optimized content file
try {
  const fileContent1 = fs.readFileSync(sourcePath1, 'utf8');
  fs.writeFileSync(destPath1, fileContent1, 'utf8');
  console.log(`Successfully copied optimized content from:\n${sourcePath1}\nto:\n${destPath1}`);
} catch (error) {
  console.error(`Error copying optimized content: ${error.message}`);
}

// Copy the enhanced content file
try {
  const fileContent2 = fs.readFileSync(sourcePath2, 'utf8');
  fs.writeFileSync(destPath2, fileContent2, 'utf8');
  console.log(`Successfully copied enhanced content from:\n${sourcePath2}\nto:\n${destPath2}`);
} catch (error) {
  console.error(`Error copying enhanced content: ${error.message}`);
}
```

Save this as `copy-file.js` and run it with `node copy-file.js` after step 2.5 and before step 2.7.

## Test Execution Plan

1. Begin with prerequisites testing
2. Run each component test in sequence
3. Address any file path issues with copy-file.js if needed
4. Run the end-to-end test
5. Validate results against expected outcomes
6. Document any issues or inconsistencies
7. Retest resolved issues

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### API Authentication Failures
- **Symptom**: Error messages about invalid API keys
- **Solution**: Verify API keys in `.env` file, ensure they are active and have sufficient quota

### File Path Issues
- **Symptom**: "File not found" errors during markdown generation or other later steps
- **Solution**: Use the copy-file.js script to ensure files are in expected locations

### Memory Issues
- **Symptom**: Process crashes with "heap out of memory" errors
- **Solution**: Use the `--max-old-space-size=4096` flag with Node.js commands

### Image Generation Failures
- **Symptom**: Missing or broken image links
- **Solution**: Check image service connectivity, verify URLs are accessible

### Hugo Compatibility Issues
- **Symptom**: Hugo build errors or incorrect rendering
- **Solution**: Verify frontmatter format, check image paths, ensure shortcodes follow Hugo syntax
